## Write Plan Workflow

1. Read the writing-plans skill:
   ```
   view_file ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/superpowers/skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md
   ```

2. Follow the skill instructions exactly — this includes:
   - Breaking down the goal into components
   - Creating implementation steps
   - Defining verification criteria
   - Organizing into batches for execution

3. Output the plan as `implementation_plan.md` in conversation artifacts.
