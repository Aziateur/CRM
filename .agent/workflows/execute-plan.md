## Execute Plan Workflow

1. Read the executing-plans skill:
   ```
   view_file ~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/superpowers/skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md
   ```

2. Follow the skill instructions exactly — this includes:
   - Working through plan tasks in batches
   - Running verification after each batch
   - Checkpointing with the user for review
   - Continuing until plan is complete

3. Update `task.md` as progress is made.
